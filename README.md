# Hackathon Project - Daira 

## Problem Statement

Currently, finding trusted plumbers, electricians, and other technicians quickly and nearby is time-consuming and unreliable.  
There is no single platform that shows real-time availability of nearby service providers.

## Our Solution

We provide a **web-based platform** where users can:
- View nearby service providers based on their location.
- Check availability, service rates, and past reviews.
- Hire them directly through the platform.

Service providers can:
- Register and update their service status (Available / Busy).
- Manage incoming service requests.
